6X4

[begin]

If you could live one day in your life

again
and again
and again

what would you change?
and change
and change

and what does it matter?

Is this the darkest timeline?
Or one of the lighter ones?
It's all just a matter of perspective...

They call you Any
And you live abroad
And you have a degree
And you are respectable

And this is the worst day of your life

I am so sorry

We have been reassessing our resources, and as we all know, we are living in tough times, so we have to lay you off. I'm afraid the severance package is out of the question because we have been told that you are not a very motivated worker.
